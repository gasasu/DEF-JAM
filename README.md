This is a basic text based adventure game based on the game "DEF-JAM".
Unlike "DEF-JAM", you go on an adventure to capture a hidden emerald worth billions.
However, you encounter certain monsters in your path.
In order to get the emerald, you need to defeat the monsters using the weapons and gifts available in the game.
I hope you have fun playing this game.
